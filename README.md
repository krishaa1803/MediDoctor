Welcome to the Medidoctor - one stop solution to all medical needs like booking an appointment with doctor or order medicines.
MediDoctor website is a medical platform with a streamlined, single-page layout that includes a main navbar and multiple interactive sections. Here's an overview of its main features:
The navbar offers smooth navigation across the single-page layout. It includes a 'Services' link with two key options: 'Book Appointment' and 'Medicine.'
The 'Book Appointment' link directs users to a dedicated page for booking an appointment with the doctor, as the feature is set up for a single doctor, removing the need for a doctor field in the Appointment model.
The 'Medicine' link navigates to a medical store page where users can explore items for purchase.
For frontend have used HTML,CSS javascript and nodejs for client server and mongodb for backend.
